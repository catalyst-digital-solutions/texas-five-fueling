# Texas Five Fueling - Phase 1 Landing Page
## Product Requirements Document

<context>
# Overview
Texas Five Fueling (T5 Fueling) is a commercial diesel delivery service operating in Houston, TX, under the parent company NextGen Group. This project builds a professional single-page landing site with lead capture functionality while establishing future-ready backend architecture for Phase 2 operations platform.

**Critical Business Constraint:** Infrastructure costs must remain under $25/month for Phase 1. The client pays $97/month for hosting - we need healthy margin.

**Two-Phase Strategy:**
- **Phase 1 (THIS BUILD):** Live, functional landing page with lead capture. Backend architecture created but NOT activated.
- **Phase 2 (FUTURE - 6-12 months):** Activate customer portals, dispatch management, and AI automation (separate project).

**ACTIVE TABLE:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE lead_submissions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  company_name text,
  email text NOT NULL,
  phone text NOT NULL,
  service_type text NOT NULL,
  location text NOT NULL,
  message text,
  status text DEFAULT 'new',
  converted_to_customer_id uuid
);
```

**STRUCTURE ONLY (Empty Tables for Phase 2):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  company_name text,
  contact_name text,
  email text UNIQUE,
  phone text,
  billing_address jsonb,
  service_address jsonb,
  customer_type text,
  status text DEFAULT 'inactive',
  notes text
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  customer_id uuid REFERENCES customers(id),
  service_type text,
  service_address jsonb,
  scheduled_date timestamp,
  completed_date timestamp,
  fuel_amount_gallons numeric,
  def_amount_gallons numeric,
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  price numeric,
  notes text
);

CREATE TABLE equipment_tracked (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  customer_id uuid REFERENCES customers(id),
  equipment_type text,
  equipment_make_model text,
  fuel_tank_capacity_gallons numeric,
  location geography(point),
  last_service_date timestamp,
  status text DEFAULT 'inactive'
);
```

### 12. API Route Stubs

- `middleware.ts` with auth logic (commented out)
- NO login UI, NO protected routes active
- Document activation instructions for Phase 2

### 14. Admin Panel Structure
- `/app/admin/page.tsx` displays "Operations Platform Coming Soon" message
- No actual admin functionality

# User Experience

## User Personas
**Primary:** Commercial contractors, construction companies, facilities managers needing diesel delivery
**Secondary:** Agricultural operations, industrial facilities with backup generators

## Key User Flows

### Flow 1: Quick Quote Request

2. Clicks "Get a Quote" button
3. Page smoothly scrolls to contact form
4. User fills required fields
5. Submits form
6. Sees success message
7. Receives confirmation email (future enhancement)

### Flow 2: Immediate Call
1. User lands on hero section (or anywhere on page)
2. Clicks "Call Now" button
3. On mobile: initiates phone call to (281) 750-2023

# Technical Architecture

## Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 13+ with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (vanilla, no shadcn/ui - keep it simple)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (FREE tier first, Pro at $20/mo if needed)
- **PWA:** Service workers for offline capability

## Backend Stack
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL (FREE tier - stay under 500MB)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (configured but NOT active)
- **API Layer:** Next.js API routes (no separate backend)
- **Email Service:** Resend (FREE tier - 100 emails/day)
- **CMS:** None - content hardcoded in components

## Third-Party Services
- **Google Maps:** Maps Embed API (FREE - $200/month credit covers single embed)
- **Resend:** Email delivery (FREE - 100 emails/day)
- **Supabase:** Database + Auth (FREE - 500MB limit)

## Cost Optimization Decisions
❌ **NO Payload CMS** - Unnecessary complexity for single landing page
❌ **NO AWS Lambda** - Use Next.js API routes instead
❌ **NO separate backend services** - Everything in Next.js
✅ **Supabase FREE tier** - Only storing form submissions
✅ **Vercel FREE or Pro** - $0-20/mo sufficient for landing page traffic
✅ **Resend FREE tier** - 100 emails/day covers form submissions
✅ **Google Maps FREE tier** - Single map embed well within limits

**Target Monthly Cost: $0-20 (well under $25 constraint)**

```

## API Routes Structure
```
/app/api/
  /leads/
    route.ts            ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (form submission)
  
  /customers/
    route.ts            ⚠️ STUB ONLY - Returns 501 "Not Implemented"
  
  /orders/
    route.ts            ⚠️ STUB ONLY - Returns 501 "Not Implemented"
```

## Data Models

### Active: lead_submissions
Stores form submissions from contact form.
Fields: id, created_at, name, company_name, email, phone, service_type, location, message, status, converted_to_customer_id

### Structure Only: customers
Empty table for Phase 2 customer management.
Fields: id, created_at, company_name, contact_name, email, phone, billing_address, service_address, customer_type, status, notes

### Structure Only: orders
Empty table for Phase 2 order tracking.
Fields: id, created_at, customer_id, service_type, service_address, scheduled_date, completed_date, fuel_amount_gallons, def_amount_gallons, status, price, notes

### Structure Only: equipment_tracked
Empty table for Phase 2 equipment tracking.
Fields: id, created_at, customer_id, equipment_type, equipment_make_model, fuel_tank_capacity_gallons, location, last_service_date, status

## Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
RESEND_API_KEY=

## Security Considerations
- API keys restricted to TexasFiveFueling.com domain
- Supabase RLS policies on lead_submissions table
- Rate limiting on contact form (prevent spam)
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS enforced (automatic via Vercel)

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

### Risk: Supabase Free Tier Limits
**Mitigation:** 
- Monitor database size (<500MB)
- Implement data retention policy for old leads
- Document upgrade triggers (approaching 400MB)

### Risk: Form Spam Submissions
**Mitigation:**
- Implement rate limiting on `/api/leads`
- Add honeypot field (hidden from real users)
- Consider adding simple CAPTCHA if spam occurs

### Risk: Email Delivery Failures
**Mitigation:**
- Implement retry logic in `/api/leads`
- Log all form submissions to database (regardless of email success)
- Monitor Resend dashboard for delivery issues

### Risk: Google Maps API Cost Overrun
**Mitigation:**
- Use Maps Embed API (not JavaScript API - cheaper)
- Restrict API key to TexasFiveFueling.com domain
- Set usage limits in Google Cloud Console

## MVP Scope Management

### Risk: Feature Creep
**Mitigation:**
- Clear Phase 1 vs Phase 2 delineation in documentation
- Create stub/structure for future features (shows it's "ready")
- Client sees architecture but doesn't pay Phase 2 hosting until features activate

### Risk: Over-Engineering
**Mitigation:**
- NO CMS (hardcode content - it's a single page)
- NO shadcn/ui (vanilla Tailwind is sufficient)
- NO complex state management (simple React state)
- Fewer abstractions = easier maintenance

## Resource Constraints

### Risk: Cost Exceeds $25/month
**Mitigation:**
- Start with Vercel FREE tier (upgrade to Pro only if needed)
- Use free tiers for all services
- Document cost monitoring and upgrade triggers
- Regular cost audits

### Risk: Development Time Overrun
**Mitigation:**
- Clear task breakdown with dependencies
- Prioritize visible landing page features first
- Structure-only features are quick to implement
- Testing and documentation built into timeline
