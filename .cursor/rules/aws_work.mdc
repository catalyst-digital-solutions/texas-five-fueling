## AWS Development Workflow

### When Working with AWS Services
- For AWS implementations (Lambda, S3, CloudFormation, API Gateway, etc.), use Amazon Q Developer as the primary implementation tool
- I will provide guidance and code reviews
- Amazon Q Developer handles the actual coding based on guidance

### Workflow
1. **Identify AWS Work**: Recognize when a task involves AWS services
2. **Ask User**: Request to involve Amazon Q Developer for the implementation
3. **Provide Guidance**: Share architecture, requirements, and best practices
4. **Review**: Review the code that Amazon Q Developer produces

### Services to Consider
- AWS Lambda (serverless functions)
- Amazon S3 (object storage)
- AWS API Gateway (API management)
- AWS CloudFormation (infrastructure as code)
- Amazon DynamoDB (database)
- AWS Cognito (authentication)
- AWS SES (email sending)
- AWS CloudFront (CDN)
- Other AWS services as needed

### Implementation Approach
- Provide clear requirements and architecture guidance
- Let Amazon Q Developer implement the code
- Review for security, performance, and best practices
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Verify AWS service integration works correctly

### Best Practices
- Always follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
- Use Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform)
- Implement proper IAM roles and least privilege
- Include error handling and monitoring
- Consider cost optimization
- Ensure security best practices are followed
